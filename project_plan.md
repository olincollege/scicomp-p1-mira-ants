# Ant Simulation Project Plan

1. If you choose to work with a partner, please share their name. If you work with your partner, you both will have the same grade for your Code Submission, Peer Review, and Presentation. Please submit individual Plans and Reflections.

    I will be working alone on this project.

1. Please describe how you will approach this modeling challenge. Be detailed- exactly what tasks are you going to do? In what order? When do you expect those tasks to be done by? If you are working in a team, who will be the lead on each task (or will you work on them as equals?). Please include a flowchart that describes how your program will work.

    I will act as PM and subteam lead for all project subteams.

    Class days and objectives (due start of class):
    - Thursday, Jan 26: Read paper and begin project plan in class
    - Monday, Jan 30: Project plan, begin work on implementation structure
    - Thursday, Feb 2: Completed initial draft of code, continue working on documentation
    - Monday, Feb 6: Code fully complete and documented. Code Review in class
    - Thursday, Feb 9: Make a presentation. Presentation Day in class

1. Please pick a computing skill to focus on during this project. For example, on this project, you could focus on timing (making it as fast as possible) or refactoring (very elegant code) or model accuracy, or pushing the limits of computing during the timeframe, or usability, or something else. You may practice the same skill multiple times. Share why you picked this skill, and exactly how you plan to practice it. Which tasks above will allow you to practice this skill?

    I plan to focus on refactoring, usability, and documentation. I picked these skills because I forgot to test out of SoftDes, and I'm hoping to use this project as my test-out project. I plan to practice these skills by making drafts of my code and progressively refactoring and documenting the purpose of all the code for usability. Secondarily, I also plan to work on model accuracy while trying to match the paper's results as closely as possible.

1. How will you benchmark your model? What result will your model have that is directly comparable to real world data? In other words, how will we know how accurate your model is?

    I plan to attempt to replicate the model shown in the ants paper as closely as possible. I will make analogous graphs and (hopefully) show that my model produces similar results.
